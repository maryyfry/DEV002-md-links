Lyrics:

Love You Like a Brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
